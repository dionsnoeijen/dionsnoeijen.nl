My name is Dion. I have been a developer for over fifteen years now. I have a wide range of interests. Currently I work on serveral interesting projects ranging from the open source [sexy-field](https://github.com/dionsnoeijen?tab=repositories){:target="_blank"} to my experiments on [codepen](https://codepen.io/octopus11/){:target="_blank"}. With this blog I attempt to explore ideas and concepts relating to my world of software development.
